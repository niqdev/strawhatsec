### Notes

Hacking is really just the act of finding a clever and counterintuitive solution to a problem

* *Machine language* consists of raw bits and bytes, and it differs from architecture to architecture
* An *assembler* is one form of machine-language translator: it is a program that translates *assembly language* into machine-readable code - the language is architecture specific
* A *compiler* converts a high-level language into machine language
* A program written in a high-level language is written once, and the same piece of program code can be compiled into machine language for various specific architectures

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name ubuntu -v "$(pwd)/books/hacking-the-art-of-exploitation:/share" ubuntu:20.04 bash
